# c-prog-modern-approach
My solutions and notes for the textbook: **C Programming: A Modern Approach**. Decided to get up to date on C programming so that I can more easily understand
the low level functionality of computers and also to help me work on my osdev project.

This repo is currently a work-in-progress and is by no means complete. There may be omissions currently for exercises and projects from chapters prior to the most recent one uploaded. This is due to my learning methodology. I like to read ahead and work some exercises and projects from future chapters without necessarily fully completing all of the work from older chapters. I then return to previous chapters for completion. I find this method of learning works well for me and helps reinforce old topics from previous by revisting and completing them a bit later than usual.

**Textbook Used:** C Programming: A Modern Approach - http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html

**Notice:** Some of the binaries were compiled on Linux and others on Windows. They are a hodgepodge based on what system I happened to be on when working on this project. I have included them for completeness but if you wish to see the proper output I recommend compiling them yourself on your system using `gcc`.

**Disclaimer:** This repository is for my own educational reference. If you wish to use it to help you learn then by all means use it; however, I make no claims guaranteeing the correctness of the exercise answers or source code provided. If you do find errors, please post them to the issues tracker.

# c-prog-modern-approach
This repository contains my personal solutions and notes for the textbook: **C Programming: A Modern Approach**. I recently decided to make a concerted effort to get up to date on C programming so that I can more easily understand the low level functionality of computers and also to help me work on my osdev project.

This repo is currently a work-in-progress and is by no means complete. There may be omissions currently for exercises and projects from chapters prior to the most recent one uploaded. This is an artifact of my learning methodology. I personally like to read ahead and work some exercises and projects from future chapters without necessarily fully completing all of the work from older chapters. At a future date, I then return to previous chapters for completion of the projects and exercise. I find this method of learning works well for me as it helps reinforce old topics and also serves to keep the learning process fresh and enjoyable.

**Textbook Used:** C Programming: A Modern Approach - http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html

**Notice:** Some of the binaries were compiled on Linux, some on Mac, and others on Windows. They are a hodgepodge based on what system I happened to be on when working on that particular section. I have included them for completeness but if you wish to see the proper output I recommend compiling the source on your own system using `gcc`.

**Disclaimer:** This repository is for my own educational reference. If you wish to use it to help you learn then by all means use it; however, I make no claims guaranteeing the correctness of the exercise answers or source code provided. If you do find errors, please post them to the issues tracker.

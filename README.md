# C Programming: A Modern Approach
This repository contains my personal solutions and notes for the textbook: **C Programming: A Modern Approach** by **K.N. King**. I recently decided to make a concerted effort to get up to date on C programming and settled on using this amazing book for my studies.

This repo is currently a work-in-progress and is by no means complete. There may be omissions currently for exercises and projects from chapters prior to the most recent one uploaded. This is an artifact of my learning methodology. I personally like to read ahead and work some exercises and projects from future chapters without necessarily fully completing all of the work from older chapters. At a future date, I then return to previous chapters for completion of the projects and exercises. I find this method of learning works well for me as it helps reinforce and test my knowledge of old topics while also serving to keep the learning process fresh and enjoyable.

I am hoping that this repository will be of a great help to others; therefore, I am attempting to give additional details about the reasoning for the solutions I have reached for the exercises alongside including annotations to the relevant book sections. Also, I am making an attempt to thoroughly comment my project solutions; however, some are lacking and I will return later in an attempt to document them better.

**Textbook Used:** [C Programming: A Modern Approach - 2nd Edition](http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html) by K.N. King.

**Disclaimer:** This repository is for my own educational reference. If you wish to use it to help you learn then by all means use it; however, I make no claims guaranteeing the correctness of the exercise answers or the source code for the projects provided. If you do find errors, please post them to the issues tracker.

# c-prog-modern-approach
My solutions and notes for the textbook: **C Programming: A Modern Approach**. Decided to get up to date on C programming so that I can more easily understand
the low level functionality of computers and also to help me work on my osdev project.

**Textbook Used:** C Programming: A Modern Approach - http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html

**Notice:** Many of the binaries were compiled on Linux. I have included them for completeness but I cannot guarantee they will run on your machine. If you want to run the code to see the correct functionality I recommend compiling the source code yourself using `gcc` on your own machine.

**Disclaimer:** This repository is for my own educational reference. If you wish to use it to help you learn then by all means use it; however, I make no claims guaranteeing the correctness of the exercise answers or source code provided. If you do find errors, please post them to the issues tracker.

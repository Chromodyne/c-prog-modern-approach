# Chapter 15 Exercises #

## Exercise 1 ##

### **Question** ##

**Section 15.1** listed several advantages of dividing a program into multiple source files.

(a) Describe several other advantages.

(b) Describe some disadvantages.

### **Answer**  ###

(a) Splitting the program can help aid the ability to compartmentalize functionality in separate files which not only aids in reusability of the code but also in debugging and narrowing down issues that may crop up.

(b) One disadvantage would be a potentially bloated source file structure made of many individual files and directories which could cause future confusion. Another aspect of that
issue would be that finding particular functions or blocks of code that one needs to modify can become cumbersome as the project grows.

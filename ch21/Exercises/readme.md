## Exercise 1 ##

### **Question** ##

Locate where header files are kept on your system. Find the nonstandard headers and determine the purpose of each.

### **Answer**  ###

On my Linux partition, headers are located in the `/usr/include` directory. 

On my Windows 10 partition there are various locations for them since they are not included with Windows by default. For example, I have MinGW installed which includes GCC which has the headers located deep in its file structure.

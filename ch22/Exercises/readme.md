## Exercise 1 ##

### **Question** ##

Indicate whether each of the following files is more likely to contain text data or binary data:

```
(a) A file of object code produced by a C compiler
(b) A program listing produced by a C compiler
(c) An email sent from one computer to another
(d) A file containing a graphics image
```

### **Answer**  ###

(a) Binary data, since object code is a compiled binary that hasn't been linked yet.

(b) Text data since program listings are code in human readable format.

(c) Text data since emails are primarily plaintext.

(d) Binary data since images are produced using encoded data.
